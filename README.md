# MC-ManHunt
ManHunt is inspired by [Dream's ManHunt Series](https://youtu.be/6GnC-N7L0Ew "Dream's YouTube Series")

There are three main roles to choose from:

**Runner** - The runner must try to beat Minecraft (kill the Ender Dragon) before he/she dies. If they are able to kill the Ender Dragon, they win.
However, if a Runner dies once, they lose the game.

**Hunter** - The Hunter must try to kill all runners before they are able to kill the Ender Dragon. The Hunter can die an infinite amount of times,
and must kill each Runner only once to win the game. The Hunter is given a compass, which will point to the closest Runner in the world.

**Assassin** - The Assassin has the same responsibility as the Hunter; however, they are able to insta-kill a Runner if they are wielding a sword.
The drawback of being an Assassin, is that you are weakened if you get caught. If any Runner looks at you, you freeze in your spot, and you are unable to harm anyone.
Therefore, you must be a lot stealthier than a regular Hunter.
